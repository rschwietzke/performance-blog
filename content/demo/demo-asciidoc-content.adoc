The following article will demonstrate all content that can be created by using AsciiDoc and JBake. We can even put `AsciiDoc` in the header of an article. For more demo stuff, look under the tag `demo`.

That works for a paragraph too. Up to the first headline.

This is also a test post for styling everything nicely and correctly. If you cannot see it here, it is likely that there has not been a style applied yet.

== Headlines - Level 1
This was not meant to be the *first bold entry* in my new blog, but accidentally interesting in**for**mation to share. Let me just write a little test here to fill the lines nicely. We just _want_ to see how that looks.

This was hard break by using a `+`.

=== Headlines - Level 2
This was not meant to be the first entry in my new blog, but accidentally
interesting information to share. Let's #highlight things#.

==== Headlines - Level 3

interesting information to share.

===== Headlines - Level 5
If we ever need that, we can even do that headline.

== Code
Ok, we can show nice code.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void test()
{
    /**
     * Just another max function.
     *
     * @param a first parameter
     * @param b second parameter
     * @return returns the max value of a and b, b if equal
     */
    public int max(final int a, final int b)
    {
        // inline comment
        return a &gt; b ? a : b;
    }
}
----
Just some more text after our code, because we might want to see if the margins
are right.

=== Inline Code
Just some `inline code` for your pleasure. More code comes here `a`, `b`, and
`c`.

== Callouts
You can comment code and relate to things later again.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void test()
{
    public int max(final int a, final int b) // <1>
    {
        // inline comment
        return a &gt; b ? a : b; // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> Library import
<2> The magic happens here.

== Lists to the Rescue
There are moments in time, when only a list can produce clarity. Such as this bullet list.

* Bullet 1 An empty line is required before and after a list to separate it from other blocks. You can force two adjacent lists apart by adding an empty attribute list (i.e., []) above the second list or by inserting an empty line followed by a line comment after the first list. If you use a line comment, the convention is to use //- to provide a hint to other authors that it’s serving as a list divider.
* Bullet 2
** Bullet 21 An empty line is required before and after a list to separate it from other blocks. You can force two adjacent lists apart by adding an empty attribute list (i.e., []) above the second list or by inserting an empty line followed by a line comment after the first list. If you use a line comment, the convention is to use //- to provide a hint to other authors that it’s serving as a list divider.
** Bullet 22
* Bullet 3

If you are not happy with bullets, you can go with numbers.

. Number 1
. Number 2 An empty line is required before and after a list to separate it from other blocks. You can force two adjacent lists apart by adding an empty attribute list (i.e., []) above the second list or by inserting an empty line followed by a line comment after the first list. If you use a line comment, the convention is to use //- to provide a hint to other authors that it’s serving as a list divider.
. Number 3
.. Number 31 An empty line is required before and after a list to separate it from other blocks. You can force two adjacent lists apart by adding an empty attribute list (i.e., []) above the second list or by inserting an empty line followed by a line comment after the first list. If you use a line comment, the convention is to use //- to provide a hint to other authors that it’s serving as a list divider.
.. Number 32
. Number 4

Ok, that was dull, wasn't it?

== Images
Images are more delightful and so we will demo them now. Let's start with a plain images and nothing fancy.

image::/images/demo/btu-cottbus-library-staircase-large.jpg[Staircase at a Library]

Just because we might want to see how much room is under the image, here is just some text.

=== Images Titles
We can and should have proper image titles.

.Staircase at a Library

=== Change the Size
.UaaC

== Admonitions
NOTE: Note - An admonition draws the reader's attention to auxiliary information.

TIP: Tip - Look for the warp zone under the bridge.

IMPORTANT: Important - Don't forget the children!

CAUTION: Caution - Slippery when wet.

WARNING: Warning - The software you're about to use is untested.

== Quotes
Let's make the quotes nice and see how that all looks.

"I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,
and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
-- Thomas Jefferson, Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Volume 11

[quote,Charles Lutwidge Dodgson,'Mathematician and author, also known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll[Lewis Carroll]']

The post should take about 5-10 minutes to read. As such, it goes deep for only a single topic, a single test, a single benchmark, a single observation.

The evidence and discussion here might be anecdotal, not actually reviewed for errors, consistency, writing style, syntaxtic and
semantically errors, duplicates, or also consistency. Use and/or trust this at your own risk.

== Tables
Sometimes we just have to put things into a more formal grid to convey its meaning. Welcome to the world of tables.

.Table Title 75%
[width=75%]
|===
|Column 1, Header Row |Column 2, Header Row

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2

|Cell in column 1, row 3
|Cell in column 2, row 3
|===

.Table Title Full Width
|===
|Column 1, Header Row |Column 2, Header Row

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2

|Cell in column 1, row 3
|Cell in column 2, row 3
|===

And the next table does not have a caption but more columns

|===
|Column 1|Column 2|Column 3|Column 4|Column 5

|100
|200
|300
|400
|500

|===

.Right Align Data
[cols="1,>2,>3"]
|===
|Column 1|Column 2|Column 3

|100
|200
|300

|===

.No header
[cols="1,>2,>3"]
