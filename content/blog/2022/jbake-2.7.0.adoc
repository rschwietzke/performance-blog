My new blog is using https://jbake.org[JBake] as the static site generator and I also
opted for AsciiDoc as the markup because a future book of mine will be written with it,
so I need a testing ground.

== Test
My name contains a non-ASCII character: é. Half of the IT-world does not get that right, but this is another topic for a blog post. So when you put that character in `jbake.properties`, it did not arrive properly in the Freemarker output. This applies to Jbake 2.6.7. Just wanted to give 2.7.0-RC6 a try and voila, it works like a charm.

Looking forward to the release of 2.7.0.
