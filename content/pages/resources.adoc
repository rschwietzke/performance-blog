== Blog
These are some of the resources I used to build this blog. I have not modified JBake at all, only needed to ensure that I run version 2.7 or higher. I removed almost all JavaScript including but not limited to tracking. The only remaining JavaScript is https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] for code styling.

== Ideas for Posts
* How to build proper test cases without thinking about positive and negative testing, using an account creation screen as example (username, password, email, name)
* Erroneous data
* Coverage is not a metric for quality
* Show why List.get() is not inlined and show what performance gain is possible with a simpler get.
* Memory allocation cost is no constant
* Tinymap vs. Hashmap
* Simple list vs. ArrayList, cache and things
* Matcher.reset vs. Pattern.matcher
* How to use Optional and why it is cool... and not that expensive
* StringBuilder instead of +? Not anymore!
