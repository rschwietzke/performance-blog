JBake 2.7 addresses issues with UTF-8 in its property file where you could not get that content into the site without an encoding problem. This is test text that goes up to the first headline even though that headline is not visible later on. We decided to mark it with `[.hide]`.

This text is right before the hide attribute.

[.hide]

My new blog is using https://jbake.org[JBake] as the static site generator and I also
opted for AsciiDoc as the markup because a future book of mine will be written with it,
so I need a testing ground.

== Test
My name contains a non-ASCII character: Ã©. Half of the IT-world does not get that right, but this is another topic for a blog post. So when you put that character in `jbake.properties`, it did not arrive properly in the Freemarker output. This applies to Jbake 2.6.7. Just wanted to give 2.7.0-RC6 a try and voila, it works like a charm.

Looking forward to the release of 2.7.0.
