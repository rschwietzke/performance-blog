# My Blog on JBake and AsciiDoc

Compatible with JBake 2.7.0

## Introduction

I wanted to set up a blog for performance related topics as well as some of my Java things for a long time. Sure, Wordpress works mostly, but a good programmer needs a challenge. No, I have not written another static content generator. I stopped sharp before that and only implemented my own theme from almost zero with the help of some JBake templates.

## How to Use

Sorry, no documentation here (yet). If you know JBake, Asciidoc, CSS, and HTML, you will figure that out quickly.

I added pinning as a feature (posts show up in a list), excerpt, and preamble handling as well as the ability to show the full post in the list of posts. Feel free to asks questions in the forum.
